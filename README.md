# Kamens family deployment automation ("orchestration")

This repository contains a whole bunch of Ansible code that I use to
deploy my family's IT infrastructure, including a cloud server, a
combination server / desktop in our house, and a couple of laptops.

There are some private files in a separate repository (the "private"
submodule) only I have access to; those are things it's too hard for
me to sanitize enough to be shareable with the public.

The commit history of this repository is sparse because I had to
collapse the commit history to remove private information. When I
first started working on this many years ago I kept it in a private,
offline repository, so I didn't worry too much about putting private
information in its files. In preparation for making this public I
edited out the private information, but of course it was all still
visible in the commit history, so the only practical way to expunge it
all was to collapse the history.

If you stumble across this and find any of it useful, or if you're
trying to use something here and having trouble, I'd love to hear from
you.

Everything in this repository is granted to the public domain by me,
its creator. In other words, feel free to do whatever you want with
it.
